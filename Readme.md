Voting dApp

# Solidity Project
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


# Contract Functionality

    -  Store Candidates
    -   Track If Voter has Already Voted
    -   Adds New Candidate
    -   Removes multiple candidate entry
    -   Retrieves All Candidates for Viewing
    -   Allows Voter to Cast immutable Vote for one Candidate only

# User Instructions
Contract interaction is currently at the 'skunkworks' stage, so pick your preference between command line interface and polygon blockchain scanner. 

- Q3 update will have a web page to interact with the voting dApp.

 # Known Issues
 There are two versions of voting contracts in this project. Tests were written for first version, and labelled for that specific contract. Running both tests simultaneously will present results for both versions asynchronously.
